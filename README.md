  # Hey, I'm George ðŸ‘‹

  I'm a Principal Customer Solutions Engineer at Cisco who architects secure systems when I'm not helping
   Fortune 500 clients protect their digital assets. My sweet spot is where enterprise security,
  developer experience, and clean architecture intersect.

  Currently building identity management experiments and running comprehensive security labs in my
  homelab environment. Over a decade of experience bridging the gap between complex security requirements
   and practical implementation.

  When I'm not threat modeling or automating security workflows, you'll find me chasing a toddler around
  the house (which doubles as my cardio) or playing shows at NYC venues.

  ## Philosophy

  Security solutions should be invisible to users but impenetrable to threats. I believe in:

  - **Defense in depth** â†’ layered security controls
  - **Zero trust architecture** â†’ verify everything, trust nothing
  - **Automated security** â†’ reduce human error vectors
  - **Practical implementation** â†’ security that people actually use
