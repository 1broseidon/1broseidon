# Hey, I'm [Your Name] ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Principal Customer Success Engineer who builds opinionated side-projects when I'm not helping enterprise customers. My sweet spot is where secure architecture, developer ergonomics, and clean UI intersect. Currently building Proximux (an identity experiment) with a Go backend and running various experiments in my home lab.

When I'm not automating something or threat-modeling, you'll find me chasing a toddler around the house (which doubles as my cardio).
